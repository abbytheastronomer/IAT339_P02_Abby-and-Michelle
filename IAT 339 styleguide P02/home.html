            <p>For girls in particular, STEM education provides rich opportunities for forming a self-image of being capable, resourceful, and able to contribute to solve important problems, which is critical for girls given their limited opportunities to act and be seen as thinkers and innovators in their daily lives.</p>

    <h2> What is STEM?</h2>

    <!-- https://www.steampoweredfamily.com/education/what-is-stem/ -->
    <p class="main-paragraph">At it’s most basic, STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. Alternatively, STEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math. But STEM education is far more than just sticking those subject titles together. It’s a philosophy of education that embraces teaching skills and subjects in an a way that resembles real life.</p>

    <!-- https://www.livescience.com/43296-what-is-stem-education.html -->
    <p class="main-paragraph">All of this effort is to meet a need. According to a report by the website STEMconnector.org, by 2018, projections estimate the need for 8.65 million workers in STEM-related jobs. The manufacturing sector faces an alarmingly large shortage of employees with the necessary skills — nearly 600,000. The field of cloud computing alone will have created 1.7 million jobs between 2011 and 2015, according to the report. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2018, the bulk of STEM careers will be:         </p>
