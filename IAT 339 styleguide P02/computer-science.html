         <!-- SOURCE: https://kids.kiddle.co/Computer_science#:~:text=Computer%20science%20is%20the%20study,need%20special%20machines%2C%20called%20computers. -->
        <p class="subject-paragraph">
            Computer science is the study of how to manipulate, manage, transform and encode information. There are many different areas in computer science. Some of the areas consider problems in an abstract way. Some areas need special machines, called computers. A person who works with computers will often need mathematics, science, and logic in order to make and use computers.
