         <!-- SOURCE: https://www.ducksters.com/science/physics/ -->
        <p class="subject-paragraph">
            Physics is a branch of science that studies matter and its motion as well as how it interacts with energy and forces. Physics is a huge subject. There are many branches of physics including electricity, astronomy, motion, waves, sound, and light. Physics studies the smallest elementary particles and atoms as well as the largest stars and the universe.

            <p class="subject-paragraph">
            Marie and her husband spent many hours in the science lab investigating pitchblende and the new element. They eventually figured out that there were two new elements in pitchblende. They had discovered two new elements for the periodic table! Marie named one of the elements polonium after her homeland Poland. She named the other radium, because it gave off such strong rays. The Curies came up with the term "radioactivity" to describe elements that emitted strong rays.

                <h4> Kinematics + Dynamics</h4>
                <p>
                    Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, objects and systems of groups of objects, without reference to the causes of motion (i.e., forces ).

                <h4> Energy</h4>
                    <p>
                        Energy, in physics, the capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, electrical, chemical, nuclear, or other various forms. There are, moreover, heat and workâ€”i.e., energy in the process of transfer from one body to another.

                <h4> Forces</h4>
                <p>
                   A force is a push or pull upon an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object. Whenever there is an interaction between two objects, there is a force upon each of the objects. Forces only exist as a result of an interaction.
